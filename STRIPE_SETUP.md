## 1. Stripe Account Setup

### 1.1 Create Stripe Account
1. Go to [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create an account
2. Complete your account verification
3. Navigate to the Dashboard

### 1.2 Get API Keys
1. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers > API keys**
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode)
3. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` for test mode)

### 1.3 Set Up Webhook (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to **Developers > Webhooks** in your Stripe Dashboard
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Enter your webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook`
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
5. Copy the **Webhook signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

## 2. Environment Configuration

### 2.1 Server Configuration
Add these environment variables to your server's `.env` file or hosting platform:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 2.2 Update Server Config
The `server/config.example.js` file already includes Stripe configuration. If you have a custom `config.js` file, add:

```javascript
// Stripe Configuration for Payment Processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || 'sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here',
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: process.env.STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY || 'pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here',
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET || 'whsec_your_webhook_secret_here',
```

## 3. Database Setup

The payment fields have been added to your database schema. Run the database update:

```bash
cd server
npm run update-db
```

This adds these fields to the `invoices` table:
- `payment_intent_id` - Stripe payment intent ID
- `payment_method` - Payment method used (card, etc.)
- `payment_status` - Payment status (pending, succeeded, failed)
- `stripe_session_id` - Stripe checkout session ID

## 4. Testing Payments

- `5555555555554444` - Mastercard

**Failed Payments:**
